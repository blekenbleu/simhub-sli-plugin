# SimHub SLI Plugin

This is a simple plugin for SimHub to add support for [SLI-Pro](https://www.leobodnar.com/products/SLI-PRO/) and
[SLI-F1](http://www.leobodnar.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=97&products_id=184/) boards.

It was downloaded from [SimElation SimHub plugins](https://github.com/simelation/simhub-plugins/).  

The intent will be to remove most of the SLI support and focus on vJoy.
